# How to publish your mod

## Introduction

This step-by-step guide is intended for mod creators who want to feature their creations on the in-game Mod Gallery. Like this:

## Prepare mod for publishing

### Add preview image

Take a screenshot of your mod in action, and save it as `preview.png`. Drop the image into your mod's root folder. It should be square and its dimensions should be at least `512x512` pixels.

### Set custom title and description

Create a new file called `mod.json`, and place it in your mod's root folder. Its contents should be set up as specified [in here](./mod.json.md).

## Publish and update

Just choose the appropriate action on your mod.

!!! note
You can publish only mods that are not tracked as **installed**, i.e. was not downloaded from the gallery but manually placed to `Content/` by you. If you are updating a mod that is already published, users that have it installed will see that an update is available for it.

!!! important
If you somehow lost original files to your mod and think you won't be able to update it? Don't worry, see how to fix that [here](./mod.json.md#publishedfileid).

## Managing your mod

Additional images, description, visibility settings and other information can be found on your mod's page on [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/732050/workshop/).
