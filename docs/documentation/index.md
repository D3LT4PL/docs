Creating API documentation from scratch is very time consuming. To help with its creation you don't need to be a programming genius, just look at the decompiled sources and write the documentation in the same way it's created (splitting into properties, methods, constructors, etc.) and use the templates. Just go to the docs repository (top right) and start writing!
